# How to use this guide

This guide is split into four parts, and it is recommended to start from the beginning and work your way upwards from it.

The first part outlines the basic principles of Flutter and gives an overview of the framework. The rest three sections each deal with creating three separate apps from start to finish. 

### Prerequisites 

The guide is written with a specific audience in mind. First and foremost the guide assumes that you have previous programming experience in any one general purpose OOP language. You should be familiar with classes, objects,  constructors and if anything sounds unfamiliar you need to brush up on your OOP and programming skills. 

The guide does not assume familiarity with Mobile development, Dart or anything else for the matter. Everything you need to create production ready Apps will be taught on the way.

### Official Docs

The official documentation of Flutter is the best in class. There are code examples. how to use widgets e.t.c. For brevity we will not cover individual widgets complete with their usage examples but will redirect you to the official docs when needed. It's also great practice to have the docs open by the side.
