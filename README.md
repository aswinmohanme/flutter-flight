# Introduction

> Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) from a single codebase.

Flutter is the best cross-platform development framework yet. It's a combination of  the best ideas from multiple place and frameworks. 

With increased flexibility comes increased responsibilities and choices. These choices can be overwhelming for a first time learner and needlessly complicates the learning process. Learning flutter is a far rewarding process when you know a bunch of basic principles and how to apply those principles to create full fledged apps. That would need some help and that is where this guide comes in.

Flutter Flight aims to teach Flutter from it's basic principle upwards. We will then build three apps of increasing complexity that would teach you how to use these principles in a real app.
